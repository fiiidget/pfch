# okay, what's next is that I want to write the player name and corresponding
# link into a csv file. I can then refer to that CSV file for the met's cards
# and if there's a match, use the brscraper tool to get the appropriate table
# from the page.

what I think that means that I need to do is write the csv, loop through the
results from the met, and then compare those two lists, and when there is a match,
pull the photo from the met and the table from bbrself.

To Do:

DONE 1. write the data to a csv file. (or would xml work better?)
2. pull all the names from the Met results
3. write that to something.
4. compare the list of names from bbr and from the met
5. where there is a match, pull the img file from the met
6. and the link from bbr
7. run the link with brscraper, which will totally work at some point
8. connect those two things together?????????\
9. I guess probably by putting them in an xml file
10. Profit
